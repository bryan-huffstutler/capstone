        <p>The restaraunt is called BBs for a reason...the owners! Brittany and Brad have been married for over 25 years and have 3 children (Judy, Mary, and John). While having two full-time jobs, Brad and Brittany were able to save up enough money to purchase the land for their future project. All the while raising three kids, two now in college, Brad and Brittany were able to build the bar from the ground up! With the new building built, Brad quit his job and began working on the menu, drinks, and atmosphere of BBs. After 6 years of saving, 3 1/2 years of building, BBs finally opened to the public! Beginning the successful story of BBs!</p>

        <h3>The Mission</h3>
        <p>Brad and Brittany's dream was to bring forth a place where adults can come together, in unity and enjoy each others company while watching their favorite sports. Somewhere people can instantaneously feel at peace, feel like they belong and have commonality with all. Good food, good drinks, and great community ties!</p>
